        <p >Technology is the biggest threat that has been rapidly emerging in the banking sector. It comes from large-scale technology firms or organizations such as Apple, Google, Amazon, eBay, and various other financial start-ups. Different traditional banks are facing disruption with these technologies. One of the significant and potential disrupters for the financial industries is blockchain technology-based applications. Various large-scale financial industries and institutions invest their stocks in banks to exchange their reserves with the central banks to begin their work and implement blockchain-based solutions for staying top in this revolutionized innovation. 
            <ul>
                <li><h3 class="heading">Blockchain technology</h3></li>
                <p>Blockchain technology disrupts the banking and financial processes of traditional banks. French-based BNP Paribas bank has been announced the utilization of blockchain technology in their financial procedures. The blockchain technology could be applied to their currency funds for processing the orders. Various financial institutions have been publicly announced interest in blockchain technology in their processes. These technologies focus on the exchange of stocks. According to the well-established financial firms, blockchain technology reduces points, costs, and time across the capital markets for the economic processes. 
                The experts view blockchain technology as the transformative technology used internally and externally by the firm. It could also be used for the start-ups to relate various financial services. 
                Payments and Remittance
                Blockchain technology is frequently used in various payment systems. Different cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin act as digital money could are also be used to send and receive payments across the globe. Although these transactions are fast and require a fast internet connection, it is also true that these transactions could take multiple minutes to confirm the transaction. The merchants do not want to pay ongoing fees for accepting payments in cryptocurrencies instead of credit cards. 
                Remittance is comparatively slow. In remittance, several things have to be considered, such as the fee is high, money could steal or interrupted, various taxes and legal issues, and the processing time is slow. But these issues could be resolved by implement blockchain technology. There are several firms are there who already started to facilitate remittance with blockchain technology. 
                </p>
                <li><h3 class="heading">Account Balances and Deposits</h3></li>
                <p> Customers generally utilize banks for holding deposits in saving and current accounts. But once a customer deposits their money in bank accounts, the bank gives loans to other customers through a fractional reserve banking system. It means, most of the money that you have seen as your account balance is not held by the bank. That’s why a bank gets failure when numerous customers withdraw their money in a massive amount at the same time. Therefore, the account balance is just an accounting entry. The blockchain is an ultimate ledger that is representing the account entries. Thus, the bank accounts could come with blockchain-based payment systems that make the banking system cheaper, accessible, and secure to maintain the banking processes. Moreover, it is also helpful to assuage the risk of bank failure. 
                </p>
                <li><h3 class="heading">Secondary Market Trading and Clearing</h3></li>
                <p>The most straightforward procedure of purchasing a company’s shares if requiring a clear and consistent settlement of the trades. The ownership of the contracts and assets that are going to be traded must be verifiable and recorded. But the clearing fee and exchange fee have been added to the essential cost of each trade, and the size of this trade varies over time and gives a considerable volume of orders. But if the ownership of the shares and customs exist of the blockchain, it is confirmed and validated immediately. It significantly reduces the clearing cost and transaction cost for all asset classes, from bonds to stocks within real estate. 
                </p> 
                <li><h3 class="heading">Primary market issuance and IPOs</h3></li> 
                <p>If the secondary market occurs on the blockchain, then the primary market also exists simultaneously. Suppose anyone has issues to sell their company’s shares. They can use blockchain for this purpose. If this procedure is accepted at a large-scale, it could cause enormous disrupter for both investment banking and asset exchange industries.
                </p> 
                <li><h3 class="heading">New Bitcoin (nBTC)</h3></li>
                <p>The financial sectors could utilize blockchain technology-enabled cryptocurrency, namely New Bitcoin (nBTC), to revolutionize the traditional banking sectors. The immutable, decentralized, and tamper-proof nature of the blockchain enables New Bitcoin (nBTC) to make this cryptocurrency ideal for reducing the streamlining cost of asset trading, retail banking, security insurance, settlement, and clearing. New Bitcoin (nBTC) is more efficient than the existing cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. It provides fast and efficient banking processes and transactions with high security and reliability.
